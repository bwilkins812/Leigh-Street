            <h3>A History of the</h3> 
            <h3>Crown and Basket</h3>
            The origins of the Crown and Basket can be traced back to an earlier establishment
            on the premises known as The Hollerith Inn.  The Hollerith was a terminus for stagecoaches
            coming into Chicago before and through the Civil War.  With the decline of coach travel and the 
            increase of rail travel, the Hollerith was struggling financially and as fate would have it, 
            the inn was largely destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.  All that remained were three
            rooms on the ground floor and a part of the tavern.  You can still see remnants of the 
            original building along the south wall.  The part of the building that survived was repaired and 
            became the Neumann Restaurant in 1873.  It was a well-known establishment and was frequently visited by
            railroad magnates and dignitaries.  President Grant, during a visit in 1874, famously quipped that
            he was "finished with State dinners at the White House.  I'm going to Neumann's."  Mr. Neumann sold
            his restaurant to the current owners in 1921 who renamed it the Crown and Basket after two
            components of the outfield wall of nearby Wrigley Field.
